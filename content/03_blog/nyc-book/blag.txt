quick list of people I'm fairly certain would be interested in paying 30$ for the book and a couple of other channels. 300$ was also a more palatable figure to shell out if no one bought the book, as opposed to 1000$

poetry and elegance, not too edgy
kept having ideas, note down
research phase
"best of" kind of project rather than narrative/project
overlap
contact sheets ?
black and white images so grayscale typography for hierarchy and contrast
