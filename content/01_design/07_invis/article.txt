Text: My photography website and main laboratory when it comes to experimenting with web novelties or new design ideas.

*Client:* Personal project
*Brief:* Redesign the website to strengthen the design. The visual language is currently incoherent, the layout's responsiveness is poor and the solution I had found for the images is dated and not very efficient or performant.
*Year:* 2015

The code for the project is on <a class="link silver hover-gold hover-strike" href="https://github.com/hemorej/invis">github</a>, I wrote in more detail about the <a class="link silver hover-gold hover-strike" href="../blog/part-1">process</a> and hereâ€™s the <a class="link silver hover-gold hover-strike" href="http://the-invisible-cities.com">website</a>
