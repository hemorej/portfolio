Title: About

----

Text: I’m a friendly bike-riding, coffee-loving person from Montreal. I develop for the web, anywhere on the stack from designing REST APIs to optimizing the front end. I’m also a graphic designer with an interest in typography, book and web design. This website is a slightly messy showcase of everything I do.

The kind of work I like to do is at the intersection of technology and art. I'm a curious person by nature and so I'm driven by a desire to figure out how things work and to create things.

I like the quiet of early morning hours.

## colophon
This website is set in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/ff_meta/" target=_blank>FF Meta</a> by the wonderful folks at <a href="https://www.fontfont.com/">FontFont</a>. It was made with <a href="http://getkirby.com/" target=_blank>Kirby</a>, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target=_blank>Foundation</a> and Sass, during a <strike>frigid</strike> sunny Montreal winter.

## reading list

Because I'm a <a href="reading-list">book</a> nerd, not exhaustive.
