Title: the invisible cities

----

Text:

This is my photography website and print shop. It's undergone many iterations but the premise is that it's a showcase 
for my personal photography projects. It includes series, a journal where I publish more frequent photographs and also 
has a shop for direct sale of prints and books.

The code for the project is on <a class="link silver hover-gold hover-strike" href="https://github.com/hemorej/
invis">github</a>, I wrote in more detail about the <a class="link silver hover-gold hover-strike" href="../blog/part-1">process</a> and hereâ€™s the <a class="link silver hover-gold hover-strike" href="http://the-invisible-cities.com">website</a>
