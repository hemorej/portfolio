Title: darkroom timer app

----

Text:

This was a personal project to design and develop an online darkroom timer for film development. I wanted to be able to 
save "recipes" to reuse for future sessions, and for the app to be quick and run in a single page. The project uses 
Vue.js and can be browsed on <a class="link silver hover-gold hover-strike" href="https://github.com/hemorej/darkroom-timer">github</a> and hereâ€™s the <a class="link silver hover-gold hover-strike" href="https://jerome-arfouche.com/darkroom">website</a>
