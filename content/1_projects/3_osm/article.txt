Title: OSM April Programme

----

Text:

This is a brochure I did as a class project presenting the April programme of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. The brief was to design a tri fold brochure presenting a particular topic. The design should make use of grids and some graphic elements and should be destined for print. I also wanted to balance the text-centric design with some photographs to keep the design appealing.
