Title: Randy book design

----

Text:

This is a design for a book I made for a friend's wedding. I had photographed the wedding myself in a semi-documentary style and the couple wanted a book form of their favourite photographs to keep afterwards. They also wanted the book to present as a narrative similar to the way they had planned the wedding and the events around it.
