Title: book watcher

Text:

I wanted to make a book of the photographs I had made on two separate trips to Japan. I really wanted to have the book be in accordion form, but printing very few copies would be prohibitively expensive. So I purchased a small, blank accordion journal and pasted small prints inside by hand. The prints are all based on darkroom prints I had made. The cover and title lettering is all done by hand as well.
