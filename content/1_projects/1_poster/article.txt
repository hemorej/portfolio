Title: Workshop poster

----

Text:

I was a member of a small photography collective called Montreal Street Photography and one spring we decided to give a workshop for which I designed the poster. The design was meant to go on a printed poster as well as the website and possibly a leaflet sized printout. Audience in mind are photography enthusiasts and serious hobbyists in Montreal or among the group's followers
