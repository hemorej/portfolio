Title: book watcher

----

Text:

This was a personal design and development project for a simple wishlist-type app. I wanted to track book release dates from different publishers and send notifications when publication status changes. The project is made with Laravel <span class="small-caps">php</span> and tachyons <span class="small-caps">css</span>


The code for the project is on <a class="link silver hover-gold hover-strike" href="https://github.com/hemorej/book-watcher">github</a>, and hereâ€™s the <a class="link silver hover-gold hover-strike" href="http://steidl.jerome-arfouche.com">website</a>
