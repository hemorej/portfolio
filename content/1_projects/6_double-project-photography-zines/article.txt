Title: Double project photography zines

----

Text:

I made four small, double-project photography zines. They're 14x21cm in size and range from 20 to 28 pages. They're printed on 118gsm semi-matte white base with a 350gsm colour cover. The binding is handmade using a three-hole binding, sewn with yellow linen thread.

The idea was for each book to contain a pair of related photography series in black and white. I specifically wanted 
there to be plenty of white space to give the photographs and each project the breathing room they needed.
