Title: Double project photography zines

----

Text:

I made four small, double-project photography zines. They're 14x21cm in size and range from 20 to 28 pages. They're printed on 118gsm semi-matte white base with a 350gsm colour cover. The binding is handmade using a three-hole binding, sewn with yellow linen thread.

Client: Personal project
Brief: Design a small book to contain two separate but related photography series in black and white. The page design should be simple and elegant with plenty of white space for breathing room.
