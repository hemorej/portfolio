Title: personal website

----

Text:

An alternate design I came up with while working on the present site inspired by a Josef MÃ¼ller Brockman poster. I decided not to go with this design as it worked better with sites that had more text content than graphics or images.

*Client:* Personal project
*Brief:* Time to design a portfolio to show some of the design work I've been doing. It should be simple enough to show the few early work available but also grow well over time as more work gets posted. The site should also feel like a personal expression since it's a form of identity, not just a blog with design samples. Need I say it should be responsive ? The audience for this is industry peers (designers, developers), potiential employers and clients.
*Year:* 2015
